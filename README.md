# Jest Learning Repository

Welcome to my Jest learning repository! This project is a collection of exercises and examples that I've created while learning how to use Jest for testing JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

## About This Project

This repository is designed to help me understand and practice various Jest matchers and testing techniques. It includes examples of:

- **Basic matchers** (`toBe`, `toEqual`, `toBeNull`, etc.)
- **Testing objects and arrays** using `toEqual`
- **Checking for null values** with `toBeNull`
- **Strict equality** with `toBe`
- And more as I continue to explore Jest's capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tarun2001jawla/learning-jest.git
    cd learning-jest
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the tests:**

    To run the Jest tests, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

## Learning Resources

Here are some of the resources I've been using to learn Jest:

- [Jest Official Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [Jest Matchers Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers)
- [JavaScript Testing with Jest](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-unit-testing/)
- [Testing JavaScript Applications](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/testing-javascript-applications)

## Branches and Commits

I am following the convention of creating feature branches for each new set of tests or topics I explore. For example, `feature/add-jest-reporting` was used to add reporting features in Jest.
